				<p>I have a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of Calgary (2007) 
				and a Master of Arts in Theory and Criticism from the University of Western Ontario 
				(2011), where I completed a one-hundred and thirty page research project on how 
				meaningful human experience is constructed through the ways in which we use language 
				to develop and individualized model of objects and relationships between them in 
				the world around us. My area of focus is semiology and structure of written and 
				visual communications.</p>

				<p>In 2012, I embarked on a long research project through which I considered the 
				meaning and place of Christian belief in today’s advanced, techno-industrial 
				capitalism. In this project, I examined this problem through the popular culture 
				narrative of the <cite>Alien</cite> series. It was published by Praeger in volume one of 
				<cite>God and Popular Culture: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Entertainment Industry’s 
				Most Influential Figure</cite> in 2015.</p>

				<p>I bring this perspective to bear on my writing about technology, where my particular
				 focus is on software and hardware design of emerging technologies. In particular, I 
				 am deeply interested in how both hardware and software user interfaces create 
				 (and sometimes obscure) meaningful interactions with technology, and determine how 
				 they are used, marketed and registered within culture. </p>
