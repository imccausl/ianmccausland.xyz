								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>I've been interested in developing for the web since before even tables were used to lay out content. When <strike>frames</strike> blink <strike>were</strike> was cool, I was guilty of overusing <strike>them</strike> it. I even made the odd web interface in a popup window. But don't hold that against me. It was how things were done in 2000.</p>

<p>Today, I'm obsessed with <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and the various awesome JavaScript frameworks that turn the web pages of old into fully responsive web <em>applications</em>.</p> 

<p>I understand <strong>Ajax</strong>, <strong>JSON</strong>, <strong>XML</strong> and, and, well, speaking of asynchronous  I am currently learning <strong>Angular</strong>. I know that a <strong>MEAN</strong> stack isn't a large and inexplicable pile of bullies, that <strong>REST</strong>ful APIs aren't an excuse for sleeping on the job, and that these ridiculous jokes are probably not going to get me anywhere (but I'm crossing my fingers anyway). I am highly motivated and serious about professional development. I learn fast and find it exciting to explore new frameworks and languages. I keep up not only with best practices and the nuances of writing scalable and modular code, but I am also interested in the key theoretical aspects of development, such as programming methodology, problem solving, and information architecture. In other words, I may not <em>have</em> a computer science degree, but I use my education and experience to learn to <em>think</em> like a computer scientist. In this context, you might be interested in <a href="#story">how my research and education as a graduate student informed my entry into web development</a>.</p>

<p>I can work with SASS and LESS and have been comfortable with the unix command line since MacOS X Developer Preview 1 (I like my Terminal.app to have a transparent background, in case you're wondering... um, but I've also been using a Mac for a real long time).</p>

<p>Oh did I also mention that I am learning unit testing with karma and end-to-end testing with protractor? I guess I didn't. But make no mistake: <em>I may not have 3,4,5+ years of web development experience under my belt just yet, but I'm serious about learning and implementing the technologies at its core.</em></p>

<p>I'm in love with Coda 2 and BBEdit, on good terms with (if not totally enthusiastic about) NetBeans, and interested in one day finding a web development IDE I simply can't live without.</p>

								<h3>Summary</h3>
								<p>My background is in textual and cultural analysis and criticism, which I applied in my graduate studies to how language structures our experience and turns it into a meaningful exchange with others and the world around us. Broadly speaking, though, my education was an intensive study of critical thinking and problem solving. I break down ideas into their elements and consider how they operate together to create a cohesive, meaningful whole, a skill that I have since become profoundly interested in applying to UI/UX design and web development.</p>

<p>Additionally, I spent <a href="#story">8 years as a TA</a>, using and developing these skills in a classroom environment in which we discussed how meaning operates at the level of various media, popular culture, and within the context of traditional (i.e. non-literate) cultures, before the advent of mass media.</p>

					<h2>Story</h2>
					<div class="flexbox">
						<p>In my past life I was a Ph.D. student in the Humanities Department at York University. I led a weekly tutorial for six years, introducing students to traditional and popular culture, for a course, aptly, if not stoically, named, Introduction to Traditional and Popular Culture. We looked at ways in which groups of human beings — i.e. cultures — understood themselves and their surroundings through shared narrative practices. That is my more general term for this fundamental fact about human beings: they tell stories. Whereas today we might binge-watch some Netflix, historically a group might gather around the storyteller, then later buy a newspaper or attend the theatre, and still later gather around the radio in the living-room. You get the idea. But the point is, this ineluctable human impulse to make meaning doesn’t begin and end with storytelling as it might be popularly concieved.</p>
						<p>As a matter of fact, I bet you have a certain idea in your head right now about what storytelling entails: it’s probably fictional, it’s probably designed primarily for entertainment, and you probably don’t take it very seriously.</p>
						<p>But what if I told you that I used this (admittedly) cumbersome phrase, <strong>shared narrative practices</strong> because this idea extends far beyond <strong>storytelling</strong> as we might spontaneously understand it? Quantum theory is a <strong>shared narrative practice.</strong> Cognitive science? That’s a <strong>shared narrative practice</strong>, too.  API documentation for iOS 10? You get the idea.</p>

							<p>After years of using a tumblr theme that I hacked together with limited CSS knowledge and (as a result) an and extreme dose of trial-and-error, I finally launched a redesign of my personal blog entirely on my own terms. It is fully responsive with a primary focus on readability. I used a very limited colour pallette because I was especially taken with the crispness of white-on-black for a layout that emphasizes textuality, although the dark blues of the pull-quotes and reds of the links add a minimal element of colour — making it easy for the reader to know when there are links embedded in the text, or, in the case of the pull-quotes, emphasizing the important takeaways from what are usually long-form articles — while still keeping with the primary focus of a text layout that harkens back to simplicity and crispness of newsprint.</p>
