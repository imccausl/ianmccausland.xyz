Every portfolio site has to start somewhere, so this is mine. I'm currently working on a new version that is more in line with 
where I am now in web development. This one began with my first, groping efforts to create a responsive grid from scratch, to, you know,
learn the basics of grids, which I then discarded in favour of flexbox instead. My media queries are kind of rough, to say the least, 
but I've since improved. My improvement is on display over in the coursera assignment section.

What else is there to say about it? It also posesses some early experiments with javascript flourishes and my first attempt to 
make a fold-out menu. I also built the image previewer from scratch, just to practice javascript and DOM manipulation...

So yeah, its a pretty crappy site, but it also stands as a monument to my new beginning.

Just like Honest Eds, that endearing urban eyesore, it will be replaced with something newer in the near future.
